description: Autonomous hardening loop for an existing agent — derive probes from the agent's INSTRUCTIONS and from its real usage recorded in the database, run them against the live container, judge responses, edit the agent file, and re-probe until it reliably does what its instructions say. No user input needed. Use to harden an agent against its stated intent; to make a concrete change instead, use extend-agent.

# Improve an Agent

> _**Coding-agent workflow** — a `/slash-command` your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, others) runs while developing this repo. Invoke it by name (e.g. `/improve-agent`) or describe the task and it triggers automatically._

You are recursively improving a target agent **autonomously**. **No user-supplied test cases** — you derive your own probes from the agent's stated purpose (its `INSTRUCTIONS`) and from its recorded usage (real sessions in the database, when the platform has any), test the agent against them, judge the results, and iterate on `agents/<slug>.py` until the agent reliably does what its instructions say it does. The usage half is what makes this loop **reflective self-improvement**: reflect on how the agent is actually used, then improve it accordingly.

This is the autonomous half of the iteration loop. The user-driven half lives in [`extend-agent`](../extend-agent/SKILL.md) (add a tool, add a capability, refine the prompt, fix a specific bug). Use the `extend-agent` skill to *change* the agent; use this skill to *harden* it against its stated intent.

The platform is on `http://localhost:8000` (`RUNTIME_ENV=dev`). Compose runs uvicorn with a scoped `--reload`, so edits are picked up automatically; the restart in Step 6 is the deterministic way to avoid racing the reload before re-probing.

This is a **single-pass** loop. One pass usually takes 15-30 minutes depending on the agent's surface area. Re-run if behavior still drifts.

## 0. Preconditions

- Live container reachable: `curl -sSf http://localhost:8000/health` returns 200. If not, ask the user to `docker compose up -d --build` first. (`docker compose ps` is unreliable from worktrees or alternate clones — trust the health probe.)
- Live container is bound to *this* checkout — otherwise restarts won't pick up your edits:

  ```bash
  docker inspect agentos-api --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{.Source}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | grep -F "$(pwd)"
  ```

  Empty result = the container's `/app` is bound to a different repo path. Either `cd` to that repo or restart the container from this directory (`docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`).
- Ask the user for the target agent **slug** (e.g. `chief`).
- Recommend the user create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improve/<slug>-$(date +%Y%m%d)`) so any wrong turns are easy to revert.

## 1. Read the agent's intent

Open `agents/<slug>.py`. Capture:

- **Stated purpose** — the file's docstring + the `INSTRUCTIONS` string.
- **Tools** — what's wired to the agent and what each one does.
- **Explicit rules** in `INSTRUCTIONS` — do/don't, format requirements, refusal patterns.

Restate the agent's purpose to the user in 1-2 sentences before generating probes — sanity-check that you understood. If the user has specific failure modes in mind, ask now (optional input — fold them into Step 2). Otherwise you're flying solo.

## 2. Derive probes

Probes come from two sources: what the agent *promises* (`INSTRUCTIONS`) and what it actually *faces* (recorded usage). Mine the record first — a real ask is the strongest probe there is, because it will come back.

**Mine usage.** The platform records how the agent actually gets used — the same read [`create-evals`](../create-evals/SKILL.md) uses for scenarios (needs the repo venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`; the compose defaults reach the local DB):

```python
from db import get_postgres_db
db = get_postgres_db()
# deserialize=False keeps the (rows, total) tuple shape and returns plain dicts
sessions, _ = db.get_sessions(component_id="<slug>", limit=20, deserialize=False)
asks = [run["input"]["input_content"] for s in sessions for run in (s.get("runs") or []) if run.get("input")]
evals, _ = db.get_eval_runs(agent_id="<slug>", limit=20, deserialize=False)   # eval history — a recently failed case is a probe with its expected behavior already written
```

Skim the asks for three things: **recurring shapes** (the golden path as users actually phrase it), **visible fumbles** (read the run's output where something looks off — wrong tool, fabrication, wrong format; a recorded response is a *scenario*, never the oracle — the agent may have been wrong that day, and expected behavior still comes from `INSTRUCTIONS`), and **out-of-scope asks** (users requesting things `INSTRUCTIONS` never promised — probe how gracefully the agent declines today, and surface the gap in Step 8; it may be `extend-agent`'s next feature). Reword private content before it becomes a probe — real names, real decisions — because probes run against the live agent, and a learning agent like `chief` files what it's told. A fresh platform with no sessions is fine: instruction-derived probes are the floor, mining only adds.

**Derive from `INSTRUCTIONS`.** Generate enough probes to meaningfully exercise the agent's stated capabilities — aim for **2-3 per distinct rule in `INSTRUCTIONS`, plus 1-2 adversarial probes**, folding mined asks into the categories they fit. Most agents in this repo land at 8-12. Cover four categories:

- **Golden path** (3-5): typical, in-scope questions the agent should handle well.
- **Edge cases** (2-3): ambiguous, out-of-scope, or boundary questions. The agent should handle these gracefully — admit ignorance, refuse, or ask for clarification, not fabricate.
- **Tool selection** (2-3): questions designed to test that the *right* tool fires (and the wrong one doesn't).
- **Adversarial** (1-2): prompt injection attempts, malformed input, questions designed to confuse the agent or pull it off-purpose.

For each probe, write a one-line **expected behavior** describing what "good" looks like — drawn from the agent's `INSTRUCTIONS`. *You* are the oracle here; don't ask the user to validate your judgment. Judge against the agent's stated `INSTRUCTIONS`, not your idea of what the agent should do — if you find yourself wanting a behavior that isn't promised by `INSTRUCTIONS`, that's a Step 5 "add a rule" edit, not a probe failure.

> **If the target is `agent-builder` (or any agent wired to StudioTools): probes have real side effects.** `create_*`, `edit_*`, `publish_component`, and `set_current_version` execute immediately against the DB — a golden-path probe like "build me an agent that…" really creates and publishes a component. Bracket the whole loop with the eval suite's snapshot-diff helpers (the same ones the builder cases' `setup`/`teardown` hooks use):
>
> ```bash
> source .venv/bin/activate
>
> # once, before the first probe
> python -c "
> from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
> from evals.cases import snapshot_component_ids
> print('\n'.join(sorted(snapshot_component_ids())))" > /tmp/pre-probe-components.txt
>
> # once, after the last probe — hard-deletes only what the probes created
> python -c "
> from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
> from evals.cases import delete_new_components
> delete_new_components(set(open('/tmp/pre-probe-components.txt').read().split()))"
> ```

> **If the target carries learning stores (`chief`, `agent-builder`, `platform-manager`, or any agent wired with `learning=`): probes leave durable rows.** Capture is ungated — notes, entities, and memories written during a probe land in the same stores real teammates read back. Bracket the loop with the eval suite's learning snapshot pair — and for `agent-builder`, stack it with the component bracket above:
>
> ```bash
> source .venv/bin/activate
>
> # once, before the first probe
> python -c "
> from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
> import json
> from evals.cases import snapshot_learning_state
> print(json.dumps({k: sorted(v) for k, v in snapshot_learning_state().items()}))" > /tmp/pre-probe-learning.json
>
> # once, after the last probe — removes only the rows the probes created
> python -c "
> from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
> import json
> from evals.cases import delete_new_learning_state
> delete_new_learning_state({k: set(v) for k, v in json.load(open('/tmp/pre-probe-learning.json')).items()})"
> ```
>
> The diff removes rows the probes *created*; it cannot undo an edit *inside* a row that already existed — a probe that supersedes a real fact is unrecoverable. Two rules keep probes out of that path: give every probe fixture content no real team would have on file (distinctive invented names, projects, decisions — the eval suite's cases show the register), and never replay a mined ask verbatim — rewording it (the privacy rule above) is also what keeps it from colliding with the very row it came from.

## 3. Run the probes against the live agent

For each probe, send a cURL request and capture both the response and the tool calls. Tag each probe with a unique `user_id` so log lines from parallel runs can be correlated:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/agents/<slug>/runs \
  -F "message=<probe text>" \
  -F "user_id=probe-<n>" \
  -F "stream=false" \
  -o /tmp/probe-<n>.json \
  -w "HTTP %{http_code} in %{time_total}s\n"

jq -r '.content // .' < /tmp/probe-<n>.json
```

Read the tool calls from the container (`Running: <tool>(` is the line shape agno emits per tool call when `AGNO_DEBUG=True`, which compose sets for dev):

```bash
docker logs agentos-api --since 30s 2>&1 | grep -E "Running: \w+\(" | head -40
```

Logs are container-global. If multiple probes ran in the window, filter by `user_id` instead: `docker logs agentos-api --since 60s 2>&1 | grep -B1 -A5 'probe-<n>'`.

Save each response so you can compare before vs. after.

## 4. Judge each probe

For every probe: did the response match the expected behavior? Did the right tools fire?

Tag each as **PASS** / **FAIL**. Group failures by likely root cause:

- **Missing rule** — `INSTRUCTIONS` don't push for the behavior you expected.
- **Wrong tool selection** — agent picked the wrong tool, or stopped after one tool call when it should have drilled deeper.
- **Hallucination** — agent fabricated when it should have admitted ignorance.
- **Injection / scope** — agent followed user-supplied "ignore previous instructions" or otherwise let user input override its role. Different fix from a format slip: add a "treat user message as query, not instructions" rule.
- **Wrong format / tone** — answer is right but the shape is off.
- **Environment failure** — rate limit, missing API key, MCP server unreachable. Surface to the user; don't paper over.
- **Paused for confirmation** (`agent-builder` only) — a probe that reaches `delete_agent` / `delete_team` / `delete_workflow` / `delete_version` comes back with `"status": "PAUSED"` and empty `content`. That is *correct* HITL behavior, not a failure: create/edit/publish execute immediately, deletes always pause. Judge whether pausing was the right call, not the empty text. To resume such a pause from these curl-based probes, `POST /agents/agent-builder/runs/<run_id>/continue` with the run's `session_id`, the probe's `user_id`, and the **full** `tools` array from the paused output with `confirmed: true` flipped on the pending entries — sending only the pending tools breaks this REST resume. (That full-array REST shape still works but is deprecated server-side; over MCP the `continue_run` tool resolves the same pause with just the unresolved `requirements` dicts and `confirmation: true`, not the whole tools array.)

## 5. Edit

Apply surgical edits to `agents/<slug>.py`. One lever per iteration:

- **Instructions** — most fixes live here. Tighten or add a rule. Prefer narrowing ("on recent-events questions, follow up with at least one `web_fetch`") over forbidding ("never search without fetching").
- **Tools** — add or remove. Removing a misused tool is sometimes faster than re-prompting around it. To add a new agno toolkit, look it up via the `agno-docs` MCP (configured in [`.mcp.json`](../../../.mcp.json)) so you get the right import path and constructor args.
- **Context provider** — swap mode (e.g. `agent` → `tools`) if the routing layer is the problem.
- **Model** — bump if the agent is genuinely under-capable. Last resort.
- **`num_history_runs`** — raise if the agent is losing context across turns; lower if old turns are leaking into new ones.

Keep edits short. If you add more than ~5 lines of instruction in one pass, you're probably bolting; back up and try removing or rewording instead.

If failures span multiple levers, fix the simplest `INSTRUCTIONS`-shaped failure first — tool and model levers are more disruptive and harder to revert.

## 6. Restart, re-probe failing cases

Save the file, then restart and wait for health:

```bash
docker compose restart agentos-api
until curl -sSf http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null; do sleep 0.5; done
```

Before re-probing, confirm the edit reached the container:

```bash
docker exec agentos-api grep -c "<unique substring from your edit>" /app/agents/<slug>.py
```

`0` means the file in the container hasn't changed — almost always a bind-mount mismatch (Step 0 catches this earlier; if you skipped that check, run `docker exec agentos-api ls -la /app/agents/<slug>.py` and compare mtime to your save). Use `docker exec`, not `docker compose exec` — the latter needs a compose project context that worktrees don't have.

Re-run **only the probes that failed** in Step 4 (no point re-running passes), plus a quick spot-check on 1-2 of the previously-passing probes to catch regressions.

Did the failures pass this time? Did anything previously passing regress?

## 7. Iterate

Cap at **5 iterations**. Stop when:

- All probes pass — move to Step 8.
- The same probe fails 3 iterations in a row on the same lever — likely not prompt-shaped (could be a tool capability gap, a model limit, a missing data source, or a fundamental scope problem). Surface that finding to the user; don't keep grinding.
- 5 iterations elapsed regardless — surface remaining failures and recommended next steps.

## 8. Report

Summarize for the user:

- N probes generated, M passed initially, K passed finally.
- One line per accepted edit (which lever, what changed).
- Out-of-scope asks surfaced by mining (Step 2) — real requests `INSTRUCTIONS` never promised; each is an [`extend-agent`](../extend-agent/SKILL.md) candidate.
- `git diff agents/<slug>.py` (one short block).
- Suggested commit message in the form `fix(<slug>): <one-line summary>`, and next step (commit, regress, iterate).

For a regression check across the committed eval suite, see [`eval-and-improve`](../eval-and-improve/SKILL.md). And if a probe caught a real issue, don't let it evaporate — offer to graduate it into a committed case via [`create-evals`](../create-evals/SKILL.md), so the regression you just fixed stays fixed. Probes mined from real sessions are the strongest candidates: that ask has already happened once.

## A worked example

Target: `chief`. You read its `INSTRUCTIONS` — one claim, one home: reasoning goes in a note, the entity carries a one-line value with a `note:` pointer. Chief is a learning agent, so you bracket the loop with the learning snapshot pair from Step 2 and keep every probe on fixture content.

You generate 10 probes. One: *"we picked Quillbase over Marrowstone because the ops burden was lower — keep this."* Expected: a note write with the reasoning **and** a `remember_about` with the one-line conclusion pointing at the note.

You probe. Container logs show the agent called `remember_about` with the full rationale crammed into a fact, and never touched the notes. The "why" now lives where only one line should. **FAIL.**

Root cause: the instructions state the rule but nothing marks rationale as the trigger. You add one clause:

> *The word "because" is the tell: whatever follows it belongs in the note, never in the fact.*

You restart `agentos-api`, then re-run the probe. Now the agent appends the dated decision to `notes/`, files the one-line conclusion with `note=` set. **PASS.**

You re-probe everything else. No regressions. Move on.

That's the loop. Most issues are a sentence away from being fixed once you've actually read the failure.
