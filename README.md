# AgentOS: FastAPI for Agents

AgentOS turns your agents into a production API and MCP server. One AI backend that serves every frontend.

1. **Your product.** Call the REST API from your app: run agents, stream responses, and manage sessions, memory, and knowledge.
2. **AgentOS UI.** Chat with agents, build new ones, inspect sessions, traces, memory, and evals from the AgentOS UI at [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-docker&utm_content=agentos-docker&utm_term=docker).
3. **Coding agents.** Manage the full agent development lifecycle (create, extend, improve, eval, review) using the skills in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/).
4. **AI apps.** Use your agents from Claude and ChatGPT using the MCP server at `/mcp`.
5. **Chat interfaces.** Chat with your agents from Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.

## Get Started

Copy this prompt into your favorite coding agent. It sets up the platform and builds your first agent with you:

```text
Help me set up my agent platform and build my first agent.

Clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-docker into a folder called agent-platform, cd in, and run the setup-platform skill (in .agents/skills/).
```

Your coding agent drives the whole flow: it checks Docker, sets up `.env`, boots the platform, verifies the MCP endpoint, connects the AgentOS UI, and builds your first agent with you. Prefer to drive yourself? See [Manual Setup](#manual-setup).

## Built for agents

This codebase comes with:

- **Chief, your team's mascot.** "Chief, we're going with PlanetScale over RDS." "Chief, zak ran a good launch." Tell it anything — decisions, who's on what, what you learned — and it files the who and the why, learns how you work, and connects the dots when someone asks what's happening. Every frontend talks to the same Chief: what you tell it in Slack is there when you ask from claude.ai or ChatGPT.
- **Two platform agents** that help you build and run the platform from your favorite AI apps like Claude and ChatGPT. **Agent Builder** creates agents, teams, and workflows using the AgentOS Studio. **Platform Manager** understands, monitors, and explains the platform: codebase questions, eval history, deployment checks, schedules.
- **Coding-agent skills** let Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents build, test, and improve the platform automatically — see [Using the platform](#using-the-platform).

Trace data, agent code, evals, and system logs are all available to coding agents, so the platform can inspect and improve itself end to end.

## Manual Setup

### Step 1: Run locally

> **Prerequisite:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-docker agentos
cd agentos

# Configure credentials
cp example.env .env
# Open .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run the platform on docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

Confirm your AgentOS is running at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

### Step 2: Connect the AgentOS UI

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-docker&utm_content=agentos-docker&utm_term=docker) and sign in.
2. Click **Connect OS**, enter `http://localhost:8000` as the URL, name it **Local AgentOS**, and connect.

### Step 3: Build your first agent

1. Click **Chat** under the **Agent Builder** agent and try the first prompt: "Build an agent that tracks AI news and writes a daily brief". Go through the agent development process.
2. Once created, click the **Refresh** button on the top right. You should now see the "Daily AI News Brief" agent in the **Agents** dropdown. Click the newly created agent.
3. Ask: "What's new with Anthropic?"

### Step 4: Check platform health

Click **Chat** under **Platform Manager** and ask: "How healthy is the platform?" It answers from the codebase and runtime data — eval history, deployment checks, schedules, and the component you just built.

### Step 5: Meet Chief

Click **Chat** under **Chief** and tell it what you're working on: "Hey Chief — I'm building a support bot." It files the who and what as entities, the why as notes, and what it learns about you stays yours. From then on, tag it in from anywhere — this UI, Slack, claude.ai, ChatGPT — and ask "Chief, what's happening?": same thread everywhere.

## Run in production

This template carries no cloud-provider layer at all: production is the same Docker Compose you already ran locally, plus the [`compose.prod.yaml`](compose.prod.yaml) override — on any host you control. A VPS, a home server, an office box, this laptop. A coding-agent skill, [`/deploy-platform`](.agents/skills/deploy-platform/SKILL.md), guides you through it. If you'd rather have a managed platform provision the database and the URL for you, use one of the cloud variants of this template ([agentos-railway](https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-railway) is the reference).

> **Prerequisite:** a host with Docker (Compose v2.24.4 or newer — the prod override uses the `!reset`/`!override` merge tags), and a way for the internet to reach port 8000 on it — a domain with a reverse proxy, or a tunnel.

### 1. Get a public URL

The platform needs a public HTTPS URL for two things: hosted chat apps (Claude, ChatGPT) reaching `/mcp`, and `AGENTOS_URL` — the address the platform advertises as its own. Any of these work:

```sh
# Cloudflare Tunnel — free; quick tunnels get a random URL, named tunnels a stable one
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000

# ngrok — reserved domains on paid plans
ngrok http 8000

# Tailscale Funnel — stable https URL on your tailnet's domain
tailscale funnel 8000
```

For a first run, an ephemeral cloudflared/ngrok URL is fine. For a real deployment, use something stable: a named Cloudflare tunnel, a reserved ngrok domain, or your own domain in front of a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx) that forwards to port 8000.

### 2. Set up your production env

Production values live in `.env` on the host — the same file compose already reads:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
AGENTOS_URL=https://<your-public-url>
MCP_CONNECT_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
DB_PASS=<generate a strong one>
```

`AGENTOS_URL` is the address the platform advertises as its own. Left unset, the daily deployment check flags the platform as misconfigured, and anything that needs the public URL — chat-app connectors, hosted MCP clients — has nothing to point at. `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` turns `/mcp` into its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server so claude.ai and ChatGPT (web) can connect; connecting asks for this secret once, on a consent page. It needs `AGENTOS_URL` for a stable public origin, and — because dev reads the same `.env` — it gates the local `/mcp` too. `DB_PASS` replaces the dev default (`ai`) — the override keeps Postgres bound to loopback, but a real password is still the floor for a production database.

One catch on a host that already ran the dev compose: Postgres reads the password only when the `pgdata` volume is first initialized, so changing `DB_PASS` in `.env` won't take on its own — the database keeps the old password and the API blocks waiting for it. Either change it in place to match — `docker compose exec agentos-db psql -U ai -c "ALTER USER ai WITH PASSWORD '<new>';"` — or reinitialize with `docker compose down -v` (wipes all platform data).

### 3. Production Auth

Token-Based Authorization is on by default. Without a `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` or `JWT_JWKS_FILE`, the app refuses to serve traffic in production. The platform's job is to keep your data private, so the safe default is "refuse to start" without an authentication token.

Token-Based Auth gives you three things:

1. **No public access.** The server rejects requests without a valid token.
2. **Per-request identity.** Middleware parses the token and extracts the `user_id`, `session_id`, and custom claims. Each request is tied to a user and session, giving you auditability and traceability.
3. **Granular permissions.** User tokens can run an agent and view their own sessions. Admin tokens read everyone's sessions and test any agent.

Mint the key at os.agno.com against your public URL:

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-docker&utm_content=agentos-docker&utm_term=docker), click **Connect OS** → **Live**, and enter your public URL.
2. Name it **Live AgentOS**, flip **Token-Based Authorization (JWT)** on — the toggle is right on the connect panel — and connect. The UI generates your public key. (Already connected without it? **Settings** → **OS & Security** → **Token-Based Authorization (JWT)**.)
3. Copy the public key.
4. Paste it into `.env` **with quotes**, so Docker Compose reads the multi-line PEM as one value:

```sh
JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkq...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
```

> **Heads up.** Live AgentOS Connections are a paid feature. Use `PLATFORM30` to get 1 month off. We are working on a free trial so you don't have to pay to try.

### 4. Start in production mode

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```

The override switches `RUNTIME_ENV` to `prd` (JWT auth on), drops the dev bind mount and hot reload so the container runs the code baked into the image, passes your `AGENTOS_URL` (and `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET`, if set) through, and rebinds Postgres to loopback so only this host — not the internet — can reach it. Both services carry `restart: unless-stopped`, so the platform survives reboots as long as Docker starts on boot.

Verify it's up and gated:

```sh
curl https://<your-public-url>/health   # 200 — /health and /docs stay public
curl https://<your-public-url>/agents   # 401 — everything else wants a token
```

Logs, when something looks off:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml logs -f agentos-api
```

### 5. Register your production AgentOS to MCP clients

Re-run `uvx agno connect`, this time pointed at your deployed domain, to connect Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, and Cursor to your production platform:

```sh
uvx agno connect --url https://<your-public-url>
```

For **claude.ai and ChatGPT (web)**: add `https://<your-public-url>/mcp` as a custom connector in the chat app's connector settings. Leave the form's optional OAuth fields (client ID / client secret) empty. Click **Connect** and, on the consent page, enter the `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` you set in `.env` in step 2.

### 6. Redeploy after code changes

```sh
git pull   # or edit in place
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```

Env changes are the same command without `--build` — compose recreates the container with the new `.env` values.

### Opting out of JWT (not recommended)

Set `authorization=False` in [`app/main.py`](app/main.py) and restart. Use this only inside a private network behind another auth layer. Without it, anyone who finds your public URL can access your platform.

## Using the platform

This platform is designed so that coding agents can drive the entire **create → improve → evaluate → maintain** lifecycle for you.

### Create

Open your coding agent of choice (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) and run:

```
/create-agent
```

It asks a few questions, generates the agent file in `agents/`, registers it in `app/main.py`, adds its description and quick prompts to `app/config.yaml`, restarts the container, and smoke-tests it live.

### Improve

Improve your agents by running the following skills:

- **`/extend-agent`** — Add a tool, add a capability, refine the instructions, fix a known bug.
- **`/improve-agent`** — Claude simulates scenarios from the agent's `INSTRUCTIONS` and its real usage recorded in the database, runs them against the live container, judges the responses, and edits until they pass.

### Evaluate

Run the eval suite to check for regressions. The evals live in [`evals/cases.py`](evals/cases.py), and run history shows up at os.agno.com next to your sessions and traces.

The evals run on the host machine, so set up the venv with `./scripts/venv_setup.sh && source .venv/bin/activate`, then:

```sh
python -m evals --tag smoke      # fast checks of the self-driving surfaces
python -m evals --tag release    # broader pre-release confidence
python -m evals --name <case>    # one case while iterating
python -m evals -v               # stream the full run with rich panels
```

If a case fails, run **`/eval-and-improve`** — it diagnoses each failure, fixes what's in scope, and loops until green. And when you build an agent of your own, **`/create-evals`** writes its coverage: it mines your real sessions for scenarios and adds cases the scheduled eval run watches from then on.

### Maintain

Because the repo is managed by coding agents, it moves fast. Run `/review-and-improve` before a release or after a refactor: it sweeps for drift between docs, code, and config, auto-fixes mechanical drift like stale paths and missing env vars, and flags anything bigger.

## Connect more frontends (optional)

AgentOS comes with an MCP server at `/mcp` (enabled by setting `mcp_server=True` in [`app/main.py`](app/main.py)), so any MCP client can call your agents, teams, and workflows through tools like `run_agent`, `run_team`, and `run_workflow`.

Register your AgentOS with the MCP clients on your machine:

```sh
uvx agno connect
```

It auto-detects Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, and Cursor and registers `http://localhost:8000/mcp`. After a successful connection, open one of these apps and ask:

```text
can you access my agentos mcp?
```

**claude.ai and ChatGPT (web).** Hosted AI apps reach your platform over the internet and need an OAuth login. Set up production (above), add `https://<your-public-url>/mcp` as a remote connector, and approve the consent page with your connect secret.

> **Heads up.** Dev and prod share the same `.env` in this template, so once `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` is set, the local `/mcp` is OAuth-gated too. Token bearers keep working: `uvx agno connect` mints a PAT, and `./scripts/mcp_check.sh` falls back to a short-lived probe service account it mints and deletes itself.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes | none | OpenAI key for models and embeddings. |
| `RUNTIME_ENV` | no | `prd` | `dev` disables JWT. `compose.yaml` sets it to `dev` for local; `compose.prod.yaml` sets `prd` — never hand-set `dev` on a production host, or the platform serves unauthenticated. |
| `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` | prd | none | Public key from os.agno.com. Required when `RUNTIME_ENV=prd`, unless `JWT_JWKS_FILE` is set. |
| `JWT_JWKS_FILE` | prd | none | Path to a JWKS file; alternative to `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` for production JWT verification. |
| `AGENTOS_URL` | no | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Scheduler base URL. In production, set it in `.env` to your public URL (domain or tunnel); `compose.prod.yaml` passes it through. Also the public origin OAuth metadata derives from when `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` is set. |
| `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` | no | none | If set (≥16 chars, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`), `/mcp` becomes its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server so claude.ai and ChatGPT (web) can connect; connecting asks for this secret on a consent page. Requires `AGENTOS_URL`. Set it in `.env` — dev reads the same file, so it gates the local `/mcp` too. PAT and JWT bearers keep working alongside. |
| `AGENTOS_MCP_SIGNING_KEY` | no | none | Optional high-entropy signing-key material (≥32 chars) for OAuth tokens. Unset, a strong key is generated and persisted in the database. Rotating it invalidates outstanding tokens. |
| `ENABLE_DEPLOY_CHECK` | no | `True` | The reference deployment-check cron runs daily by default. Set `False` to disable; the workflow is runnable on demand regardless. |
| `EVALS_TAG` | no | `smoke` | Eval tag run by the run-evals workflow. |
| `EVALS_CASE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `90` | Default per-case timeout for run-evals runs; applies only to cases that don't set their own `timeout_seconds`. |
| `EVALS_SUITE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `900` | Whole-suite timeout for run-evals runs; per-case timeouts are the granular limit. The default bounds the `smoke` tag's worst case (incl. builder-case teardown). |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | no | none | Authenticates Chief's and the Studio registry's web search tools (Parallel SDK when set; keyless MCP fallback). |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | no | none | Both must be set to enable the Slack interface. |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASS` / `DB_DATABASE` | no | matches compose | Postgres connection. |
| `DB_DRIVER` | no | `postgresql+psycopg` | SQLAlchemy driver. |
| `AGNO_DEBUG` | no | `False` | If `True`, Agno emits verbose debug logs. Compose sets this for dev. |
| `WAIT_FOR_DB` | no | `False` | If `True`, the entrypoint blocks on the DB before starting. Compose sets this. |
