Eval Cases
==========

Each case is an `agno.eval.Case`

- When `criteria` is set, `AgentAsJudgeEval` scores the response (binary pass/fail) using an LLM.
- When `expected_tool_calls` is set, `ReliabilityEval` checks if `expected_tool_calls` were fired.

Results are stored in Postgres via `eval_db` and are visible at os.agno.com.

Add a case below, tag it (`smoke`, `release`, `live`), then run:
`python -m evals --tag <tag>`
